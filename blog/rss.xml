            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey, hello, welcome to Chronify!. I'm super excited for this project that I think that can bring a lot of value to the community. I'm going to try to keep this post short and sweet, but I want to give you a little bit of context about what Chronify is and what it's going to be.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/screenshot-4ccce6ce518525feedc78d22fb08297e.png" width="2042" height="714" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-chronify">What is Chronify?<a href="#what-is-chronify" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Chronify?" title="Direct link to What is Chronify?">â€‹</a></h2><p>Technically speaking, Chronify is a solution that allows you to schedule triggers to any HTTP Webhook. This means that you can schedule a trigger for any webhook that you want, and Chronify will make sure that it's triggered at specific intervals that you can define. This is a very powerful tool that can be used for a lot of different things, and I'll try to give you a few examples of what you can do with it.</p><p>Personal speaking, Chronify is the result of my frustration dealing with the lack of a <b>simple</b> scheduling solution for webhooks. If I have a function that I want to run every 5 minutes, I can't just schedule it to run every 5 minutes, I need to deal with service accounts, authorizations, internal or external traffice allowance, learning whats the logic behind the scheduler or the other components that I need to understand to use it and I can imagine thats a very common problem, and I'm sure that you've dealt with it before. <b>Chronify</b> is my attempt to solve this problem.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-can-i-do-with-chronify">What can I do with Chronify?<a href="#what-can-i-do-with-chronify" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What can I do with Chronify?" title="Direct link to What can I do with Chronify?">â€‹</a></h2><p>Let me give you a few examples of what you can do with Chronify:</p><ul><li>You can schedule a trigger for a webhook allows you run a cloud function every X amount of minutes.</li><li>You can schedule an action for a webhook allows you to automate some tasks that you used to do manually. For example, backup your databases every 24 hours, clean up your logs every 7 days, etc.</li><li>I'm using Chronify to schedule a trigger to a push notification remind me to drink water every 2 hours. I'm also using it to remind me to take my vitamins every day at 8:00 AM.</li><li>You can use Chronify to schedule a trigger to a webhook that will send you a notification when a specific event happens. For example, you can schedule a trigger to a webhook that will send you a notification when a new post is published on your blog.</li><li>Chronify is a API first solution, that's mean that you can create your task with dynamic information that you get from other API or systems.</li></ul><p>These are just a few examples of what you can do with Chronify, but I'm sure that you can come up with a lot of other use cases. Stay tuned to this blog and the documentation to see more examples of what you can do with Chronify.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-much-does-it-cost">How much does it cost?<a href="#how-much-does-it-cost" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How much does it cost?" title="Direct link to How much does it cost?">â€‹</a></h2><p>Chronify is free to use, with the <b>free</b> plan you can schedule up to 5 tasks/triggers. For now this is the only plan that we have, but we're working on a paid plan that will allow you to schedule more tasks with more features.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-can-i-get-started">How can I get started?<a href="#how-can-i-get-started" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How can I get started?" title="Direct link to How can I get started?">â€‹</a></h2><p>You can get started with Chronify by creating an account through our API.

Here are some of the features that we're working on (with more to come!):</p><ul class="contains-task-list containsTaskList_mC6p"><li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled=""> <!-- -->Add support for more time intervals.
